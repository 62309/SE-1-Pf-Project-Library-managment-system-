 * Project Overview

The Library Management System (LMS) is a software solution designed to manage and streamline library operations efficiently. Developed using C++, the system will facilitate the management of book inventories, user accounts, borrowing and returning processes, and report generation. The LMS will be robust, user-friendly, and capable of handling large volumes of data, ensuring an organized and accessible environment for library staff and members.

* Objectives

· To develop an efficient, reliable, and secure system for managing library resources.

· To automate routine library tasks, such as book cataloging, member registration, and transaction tracking.

· To enhance user experience by providing easy access to available books and borrowing history.

· To minimize human error and improve data accuracy.

 * Stakeholders

· Library Members: Users who will borrow and return books.

· Librarians/Staff: Individuals responsible for managing the library’s operations.

· Library Administrators: Personnel overseeing the system and handling administrative functions.

· Developers: The team responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining the LMS.

* Functional Requirements

FR-1 Manage User Accounts – The system should manage library users, including registering new users and updating details for existing users.

FR-2 Add Books – The system should allow adding new books, including details like title, author, ISBN, and category.

FR-3 Issue Books – The system should provide options for users to issue and return books, with dates recorded for issuing and returning.

FR-4 Search Books – The system should offer a search feature, allowing users to search by title, author, or ISBN.

FR-5 Update Book Records – The system should allow updating book information, such as changing the title or availability status.

FR-6 Delete Book Records – The system should include a feature for deleting books that are unavailable or removed from the library.

FR-7 View All Books – The system should have a list view to display all available books in the library.

FR-8 Check Availability – Users should be able to check if a specific book is currently available.

* Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-1 Performance: The system should be responsive and able to handle requests within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 2 seconds).

NFR-2 Scalability: The LMS should be designed to handle future growth, including an increased number of users and book records.

NFR-3 Usability: The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly for non-technical users.

NFR-4 Reliability: The system should be reliable with minimal downtime and robust error-handling.

NFR-5 Security: User data and transaction records should be protected, with secure login credentials and data encryption.

NFR-6 Maintainability: The code should be well-documented and modular, allowing for future updates and modifications.

* System Constraints

Hardware Limitations: The system should be optimized to run on standard desktop computers with moderate specifications.

Development Environment: The system will be developed using C++ and will rely on standard libraries and frameworks that are compatible with the target environment.

Data Storage: The system will use a file-based approach or a lightweight database such as SQLite to manage data storage.

Compliance: The LMS should adhere to data protection laws and ensure user privacy.

Budget and Timeline: The project must be completed within a set budget and timeframe, which may limit feature expansion and third-party integrations.

This proposal outlines the essential aspects of the Library Management System in C++, ensuring that stakeholders are aware of its purpose, requirements, and development constraints.
